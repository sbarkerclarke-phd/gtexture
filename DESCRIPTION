Description: Generalizes application of gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM)
    metrics to objects outside of images. The current focus is to apply GLCM
    metrics to the study of fitness landscapes in evolutionary biology,
    particularly the evolution of cancer resistance. A general reference to
    learn more about mathematical oncology can be found in Rockne et al. (2019)
